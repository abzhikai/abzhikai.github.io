            <h1>About Manga</h1>
            <p>
                Manga is a term used in Japan to refer to comics or graphic novels. 
                Outside of the country the word is typically used to refer to comics originally 
                published in the country.

                Manga stories are usually printed in black and white due to time constraints, 
                artistic reasons and to keep printing prices low. In Japan, manga are usually 
                serialized in large manga magazines which contain many stories, each having one 
                episode of the stories to be continued in the next issue.

                Most manga conform to a style developed in Japan in the late 19th century
                and the form has a long history in earlier Japanese art.

            <h1>Manga in Comparison to Light Novels and Anime</h1>
            <p>
                Some manga are adapted from the stories of Light Novels and turned into Anime. 
                In comparison to its story telling counterparts, when it comes to telling the story, 
                Light Novels usually have the full uncut plot of the story written down and as for 
                anime, it has the best visual representation of the story. Manga is the center with 
                a mix of both, having a good mix of each.
